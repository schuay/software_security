Analysis of a Web Application

Business Worldwide Solutions is a business oriented newspaper focusing on
business news. They recently switched their web presence to an in-house CMS.
The implementation is early beta, but management decided to go live anyways. It
took only a few days until they were HACKED! The attackers seemed to be some
sort of animal activists, at least the CEO thinks so, due to all the pony
pictures that they left on the website. You were called in to help analyse what
happened, and to fix the implementation so that incidents like these can't
happen anymore. The only thing they give you, despite plenty of pressure that
the system has to be back online soon, a copy of the machine as VM - the
username is "softwaresec", the password is "password". Steps to do:

* Create a timeline of the events. You don't need to reconstruct dates, but
  rather try to figure out the steps the attackers took in order to bring the
  site into the current state.  

* Explain if the attackers could have gone beyond defacing the website and what
  they might have managed to do.  

* Categorize the vulnerabilities according to the OWASP Top Ten. (These may
  also give you hints, in case you have missed some vulnerabilities.) 

* Fix the web app, so all holes are closed. Try to keep your solution as simple
  as possible and explain what you did & where to fix the holes.

Please upload a PDF with your report. For multiple files (e.g., diffs) please
use ZIP. 

Note: The VM is not included in this repo since even its compressed size
exceeds 500 MiB.
