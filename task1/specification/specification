OpenSSH is a widely used open-source tool, but of course you know that already.
You did "Introduction to Security", and telnet has never been an option for
you. However, this task is not about reading SSH - it's about backdoorin' it.

Some time ago you got access to a some server, and somehow the admin left
/usr/sbin/ world writeable. You already had some fights with the admin about
security, and he just never listened. So before he can kick you from the box,
you think: maybe some persistent access mechanism is worthwhile.

Your goal is to modify the source code of the openSSH server to allow a given
keypair remote access, hard coded in the source. You should use the provided
keypair here. You'll have to change logging as well, to stay stealthy. Compile,
test and include patches for every file modified (“diff”) in your submission.

Please upload a ZIP including the the patches (diff) for all changed files, as
well as a detailed report for documentation and explaining how you solved this
assignment.
