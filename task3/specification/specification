Analysis of a Binary

When you try to run the binary, you'll immediately see that is not doing much,
because it is controlled by some kind of trigger condition.

This assignment consists in two parts:

program.  Reverse engineer the check, set the right condition and find the
secret message.

Recommended tools:

Debugger, Hexeditor, ...

Please upload a PDF with your report (you do not have to upload the modified
binary)!
